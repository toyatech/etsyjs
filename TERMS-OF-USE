API Terms of Use
Introduction

Below this introduction is quite a bit of important legal language. Please read it.

Inside Etsy, we talk a lot about the importance of humanity, honesty and transparency in our communications. So, before you read on to the important legalese, we want to share a few thoughts in human and honest terms.

Etsy believes in the power of APIs to unleash the talents of developers around the globe to build new applications that extend Etsy's utility and help build the world's most vibrant handmade marketplace.
We are trying to build Etsy into a profitable and lasting company. Thus, there are several important guidelines in our APIs related to "commercial use" and driving transactions back to Etsy. Please pay particular attention to those sections.
Etsy operates in a highly dynamic industry. We cannot anticipate what new technologies or developments will change "the rules of the game." We only know that change occurs, and that it occurs quickly on the Internet. So, we do expect to periodically, perhaps even regularly, change these Terms of Use.
We are constantly evolving and, hopefully, improving Etsy.com, building new features and providing more benefits to buyers and sellers. It is possible that Etsy's current or future product road map may overlap with products or features that a developer has already built. This overlap of features occurs in most API communities.
Most content on Etsy (with the notable exception of our blog) is user generated. The pictures, descriptions and stories about the items for sale (among other things) are owned by Etsy's members, not by Etsy. As part of this API, we are providing a sublicense to reuse this content "in the spirit of Etsy." That is, by nature, a subjective statement, and Etsy must reserve the right to determine — as fairly as possible and considering the concerns of Etsy's members first — when an application is not in the "spirit of Etsy". We expect that most applications will indeed bask in Etsy spirit.
Etsy supports developers, and we want the entire community — not only buyers and sellers, but also developers — to prosper. Some developers do this for the sake of coding, some do it for fun, and some do it to make money. Coding is not much different than crafting. Etsy sellers become experts at their crafts. Some do it for the joy of creating things of beauty, some do it for fun, and many also do it to make money. So, again, please read carefully the section around "commercial use." We want developers to be able to earn money to support their efforts making Etsy applications. We also want to make Etsy a profitable, lasting company that can empower people to change the world's economy.
Thank you for being part of Etsy. If you have any questions, contact us at developer@etsy.com. We welcome you and look forward to working with you.

Termination of a license to use the Website and/or the API does not constitute termination of these Terms.

Etsy may amend these Terms, including, without limitation, the agreements and policies incorporated herein by reference, at any time. When Etsy changes any such agreement or policy in a material way a notice will be posted on the Website, and when any change is made in any such agreement or policy, the updated agreement or policy, as applicable, will be posted at the applicable link above or a successor link.

Subject to the following paragraph, You acknowledge and agree that no right, title or interest in any Content is transferred to You as a result of Your use of such Content, the Website, the API or any services provided or otherwise made available via the Website.

Etsy and its affiliates do not claim ownership of the Member Content and shall have no obligation of any kind with respect to such Member Content, in each case except to the extent expressly assumed under written agreement. You may not do or allow anyone else to do anything with the Content which is not specifically permitted under the Terms.

As between You and Etsy, You are also solely responsible for all aspects of Your Application.

8. Term

The Terms take effect on the date You accept them and will continue until expiration or termination. Etsy reserves the right at any time in its sole discretion to terminate the Terms, with or without notice. Upon termination of the Terms for any reason, Your access to the Website, the API and Content, and all of Your user's rights herein, will cease. Rights and obligations under this API Terms of Use Agreement, as well as any rights or obligations under any of the agreements or policies incorporated herein by reference, which either by their nature should survive or which by their terms expressly survive will remain in full effect after any termination or expiration of the applicable document, including without limitation those of Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 16 of this API Terms of Use Agreement.

9. Website Human Use Restriction And Use of API

The API is the only supported method for users to access data programmatically from Etsy. The Etsy Website, including Content and applications is published solely for direct access by human users. 'Spiders', 'crawlers', 'bots' and all other automated software or hardware devices designed to access and 'read' or otherwise analyze the Website independently are prohibited unless they are expressly so authorized by Etsy. For example, you agree not to:

'Screen scrape' pages on the Etsy Website, even if such data is not available in the Etsy API.
Reverse engineer internal data feeds used by the Etsy Website, including Etsy's flash applications, even if such data is not available in the Etsy API.
Access legacy or internal APIs used by Etsy but not available through the public API.

16. General Terms

Equitable Relief. You agree that any breach of the Terms will result in irreparable harm to Etsy or its affiliates for which damages would be an inadequate remedy and, therefore, in addition to its rights and remedies otherwise available at law, Etsy or its affiliates will be entitled to equitable relief, including both a preliminary and permanent injunction, if such a breach occurs or is threatened. You waive any requirement for the posting of a bond or other security if Etsy or its affiliates seek such an injunction.

No Agency. You acknowledge and agree that the relationship between You and Etsy and its affiliates (if applicable) is that of independent contractors. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as creating a partnership, contract of employment, agency, joint venture or franchise relationship between Etsy or any of its affiliates with You.

Waiver. Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under the Terms will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation of non-enforcement. Any waiver of the Terms must be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement of the waiver is sought. If any provision of the Terms is held invalid by any law or regulation of any government, or by any court or arbitrator, the parties agree that such provision will be replaced with a new provision that accomplishes the original business purpose, and the other provisions of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.

No Third Party Beneficiary. You acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Terms, there shall be no third party beneficiary to this agreement.

Choice of Law. The Terms shall in all respects be interpreted and construed with and by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties hereby disclaim the application of the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. The sole and exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions and disputes arising under the Terms will be the state and federal courts in the Southern District of the State of New York. You hereby agree to service of process in accordance with the rules of such courts. The party prevailing in any dispute under the Terms shall be entitled to its costs and legal fees.

Entire Agreement. The Terms constitute the entire agreement between You and Etsy relating to their subject matter, and cancel and supersede any prior versions of the Terms as well as all prior agreements (whether oral, written or otherwise) and representations between You and Etsy. No modification to the Terms will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized Etsy representative. You may not assign, sublicense, delegate or otherwise transfer the Terms or any right granted hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, and any attempt to do any of the foregoing in violation of this provision will be null and void. Etsy expressly reserves the right to assign the Terms and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder. The Terms are binding on and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and their heirs, successors and permitted assigns.
